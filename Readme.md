### Car service app

This is my car service app where you can collect data from your car and drivings, fuel consumptions and services. First you have to add your car to app before you can start monitor your car cost (fuel, maintenance, driving diary).

#### How to install

First you have to clone this repo and go to backend folder. Here you have to run command `npm install` which installs the needed files. You can start backend with command node server.js in your backend/db/ folder.

After that you go to your frontend folder and run command `npm install` which installs needed files. After that you you run command `npm run dev` which starts the frontend. 

And as you can see in the screen just open that link in your web browser. e.g. http://127.0.0.1:5173 and you can start collect data from your car.
